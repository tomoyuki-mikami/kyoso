# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add maintainer-only source MCP templates `examples/codex-source-config.toml`
  and `examples/claude-code-source-mcp.json`. They register the distinct server
  name `kyoso-source` so the current checkout can be reviewed without shadowing
  the installed Plugin or a published-CLI registration. Both are excluded from
  the npm package.
- Document maintainer runtime selection in `AGENTS.md` and in
  `docs/kyoso_detailed_design.md` §23.3. `plugin:verify` now fails when a
  project-local MCP registration — `.codex/config.toml` or `.mcp.json` — is
  tracked again, and `.gitignore` keeps the untracked maintainer copies out of
  `git add`. `.gitignore` also covers the two paths `kyoso setup` writes
  without `--global`: the `.kyoso-install.json` marker it puts in this
  repository's canonical Skill, and the project-local `.claude/skills/` copy.
  `.claude/worktrees/` is ignored separately, as agent scratch space.
- Add the maintainer-only `dev:mcp` script, which runs the MCP server from the
  current source.
- Harden `pack:verify` against two ways maintainer-local state could reach the
  npm package. It now rejects a `.kyoso-install.json` Skill install marker in
  the tarball, which `kyoso setup` writes into this repository's canonical Skill
  when run without `--global`. `.gitignore` keeps an untracked marker out of
  `git add`, but `npm pack` does not consult it while a `files` allowlist is in
  place, so `pack:verify` is the only publish-stage gate, tracked or not.
  `pack:verify` also checks the two halves of the maintainer-only example
  exclusion separately — the packed manifest must still declare the `files`
  negation glob, and the verifier's own pattern must still match a real entry
  under `examples/` — so a rename or typo cannot leave the check passing
  without checking anything.

### Changed

- Select the CLI package through the npm alias `kyoso-cli@npm:@kyo-so/cli` in
  every package-runner path: generated `kyoso setup` registrations, Marketplace
  Plugin MCP definitions, Skill CLI fallbacks, manual-registration examples,
  and documentation. Without the alias, a package runner invoked from a
  checkout whose own package name is `@kyo-so/cli` can resolve that workspace
  instead of the published package. Existing unaliased registrations keep
  working; `kyoso doctor` reports most of them as `repair required (legacy)`
  and `kyoso setup <client> --write --force` rewrites the Codex config and a
  project-scoped `.mcp.json`. Two cases are kept rather than rewritten. A
  Claude Code registration in a user config (`~/.claude.json`) is outside that
  safe target, so doctor and setup ask you to update it by hand instead of
  offering a repair command. An exact legacy Bun entry is kept when no runner
  is named, and a runner-explicit repair does migrate it:
  `--runner bunx --force` verifies Bun and stays on it, and
  `--runner npx --force` moves it to npx. Setup lists both; doctor offers the
  one matching the registration's own runner. The reverse also holds
  during the upgrade window: an aliased registration written by hand from the
  updated examples is reported as `custom/unverified` by a `0.16.7` doctor,
  which predates the alias. Upgrade the CLI before rerunning doctor.
- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.16` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions and Skill fallbacks to `kyoso-cli@npm:@kyo-so/cli@0.16.7`.
  This supersedes `0.7.15`, which pinned the same CLI version without the
  alias. `0.7.15` carries no release tag, but the marketplace entry points
  resolve this repository's default branch, so anyone who installed or updated
  the Plugin after that commit already has the unaliased pin; run
  `/plugin update kyoso` (or the Codex equivalent) to pick up `0.7.16`.
- Report which legacy shape a manual MCP registration has. `kyoso doctor` and
  `kyoso setup` now state whether the argv relies on executable inference or
  omits the alias, rather than calling both "a legacy invocation".
- Offer a Bun registration its own runner when repairing it. `kyoso doctor`
  previously proposed `--runner npx --force` whenever npx was available, which
  moved a working Bun registration to npx without saying so. It now prefers
  `--runner bunx --force` for a Bun registration when an installed Kyoso CLI
  and `bunx` are both present, and names the runner change whenever the repair
  it offers lands on a different runner than the registration already uses.
- Extract the Plugin CLI pin from the aliased argv in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, matching the alias adopted above.

### Removed

- Remove the tracked `.codex/config.toml`. Its project-local
  `mcp_servers.kyoso` entry silently took precedence over the installed Plugin
  and over a maintainer's own MCP registration, so every dogfooding review ran
  an unintended runtime. That entry also resolved the CLI through `@latest`
  rather than an exact pin and passed
  `--safe-chain-skip-minimum-package-age`, waiving the minimum-package-age
  check. Forwarding the generated credential set is normal for a Kyoso MCP
  entry; what this project's own documentation tells users to avoid is handing
  that set to an unpinned, age-check-waived resolution.

### Fixed

- Correct the stale `tool_timeout_sec` in the `docs/kyoso_detailed_design.md`
  §23.1 Codex examples from `360` to the `2160` that `kyoso setup codex`
  actually generates. `examples/codex-config.toml` and the README
  troubleshooting section already used `2160`.
- Re-sync the Skill excerpt quoted in `docs/kyoso_detailed_design.md` §22.2
  with `.agents/skills/kyoso-review/SKILL.md`, which had gained a note that the
  Bun fallback needs a Bun version supporting `bunx --package`. Nothing
  compares that excerpt against the Skill, so the two can drift again.
- Mark the `package.json` sketch in `docs/kyoso_detailed_design.md` §24 as
  dating from the MVP. Its `version` and `files` had both moved on, and `files`
  now carries the maintainer-only example exclusion this release adds.

### Known issues

- The Marketplace Plugin manifest and the mirrored Skill both declare the
  `kyoso` MCP registration, so Codex can emit a
  `missing command for stdio dependency` warning when the Skill loads. Removing
  the duplicate is a Plugin public-contract change and is deferred out of this
  work; `docs/kyoso_detailed_design.md` §22.3 carries the details.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Accept numeric seconds aliases for public config, CLI overrides, MCP/library
  request timeouts and review budgets, and the `runReview()` progress heartbeat
  while preserving millisecond inputs and canonical millisecond outputs.

### Changed

- Close machine-marked Plugin promotion reminders with an audit comment only
  after complete verification succeeds on `main`, while keeping pull requests
  and non-`main` manual runs read-only.
- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.7` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions and Skill fallbacks to `@kyo-so/cli@0.15.2`.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Keep Codex ACP doctor and smoke assertions synchronized with the default
  configuration while preserving the exact SemVer pin invariant, so dependency
  updates no longer fail on duplicated version literals.

- Update the default ACP adapters to
  `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.7` and
  `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.61.0`.
- Update protocol dependencies to `@agentclientprotocol/sdk@1.3.0` and
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0-beta.5`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Restore Claude Code authentication for Marketplace Plugin launches by
  explicitly forwarding optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` placeholders into the MCP
  subprocess.
- Run the exact published first-party CLI smoke before Safe-chain CI shims are
  installed, preventing wrapper metadata notices from contaminating MCP NDJSON.

### Changed

- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.5` while retaining
  `@kyo-so/cli@0.15.0` in its Codex and Claude Code MCP definitions and Skill
  fallbacks.
- Allow Plugin-only promotion to retain the current CLI pin while rejecting a
  pin rollback and preserving exact published-CLI runtime verification.
- Update the default ACP adapters to
  `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.5` and
  `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.60.0`.
- Update CI and development dependencies to `actions/setup-node@v7`,
  `@aikidosec/safe-chain@1.5.13`, and `prettier@3.9.6`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Add `agents.codex.openRouter` retry configuration for OpenRouter Codex
  reviews. It maps idle timeout, stream retries, and request retries to the
  fixed provider preset without changing omitted Codex runtime defaults.
- Record observed ACP stream retries, discarded retry-message bytes, and ACP
  output timestamps in model-call audit records and JSONL trace events.
- Add typed core review-progress events, bounded non-blocking progress delivery,
  CLI stderr renderers (`auto`, `plain`, `jsonl`, and `off`), and graceful
  SIGINT cancellation through primary and verifier ACP subprocesses.
- Add MCP `notifications/progress` support when a client provides a
  `progressToken`, with per-request monotonic sequences and fixed-field messages.
  Whether progress is displayed remains client-dependent.
- Propagate MCP cancellation through primary and verification ACP subprocesses
  and in-flight OpenAI or Anthropic judge calls without converting cancellation
  into a normal result or judge fallback.
- Add a release-gated mock Responses SSE integration suite for the pinned Codex
  ACP adapter, covering stream retries and exhaustion without credentials or an
  externally configurable provider base URL.

### Fixed

- Prevent incomplete Codex message chunks from leaking into final agent output
  after a structured stream retry, while retaining full wire-byte accounting
  and output-limit enforcement.
- Bound retry-progress trace writes per primary agent and preserve retry
  metrics when an output cap stops a session.
- Treat a terminal Codex ACP system error as a failed agent result even when
  the adapter returns an ACP `end_turn` response.

### Changed

- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.3` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions and Skill fallbacks to `@kyo-so/cli@0.14.0`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.2` and make its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions explicitly launch the `kyoso` executable from
  `@kyo-so/cli@0.13.1`, avoiding ambiguous npm executable inference.
- Align new manual MCP setup, Skill fallbacks, documentation, and client
  examples with explicit npx/bunx package-and-executable commands. Existing
  custom, execution-altering environment, or unknown registrations remain
  untouched; `--write --force` migrates a safe exact legacy npx command. Legacy
  bunx is preserved without a `--runner` and requires explicit `--runner bunx`
  verification or intentional `--runner npx` migration. Current bunx
  registrations can be capability-checked without changing their bytes.
- Add local multi-bin package smoke, exact published npx/bunx artifact smoke,
  PATH-sentinel fallback detection, and fail-closed promotion verification with
  rollback after a post-write failure. These durable CLI changes ship with the
  next CLI release; they do not retroactively alter the already-recovered
  Plugin `0.7.2` artifact.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- Update `@modelcontextprotocol/server` from `2.0.0-beta.3` to
  `2.0.0-beta.4`, adopting the shared `@modelcontextprotocol/core` runtime
  dependency and lazy validation-schema construction.
- Update the default `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` adapter from
  `0.58.1` to `0.59.0` for background-subagent lifetime handling, result-text
  forwarding, and refined streamed tool calls.
- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.7.0` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions to `@kyo-so/cli@0.13.0`, delivering output-budget
  recalibration, execution identity reporting, shared deadlines, and bounded
  ACP transport through the Plugin runtime.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Add a read-only `kyoso-budget-report` package bin and `audit:budget-report`
  source script for explicit trusted trace directories, with execution grouping,
  separate all-call/normal-path byte percentiles, token-reporting rates,
  call-correlated output-limit signals, root-identity-anchored traversal,
  bounded trace ingestion, sanitized metadata, and completion/skip reasons.
- Expose effective model execution identity in Audit events and JSON/Markdown
  results while keeping requested-only and provider-reported values distinct.

### Changed

- Raise the default Codex and Claude timeouts to 600 seconds and the review-wide
  deadline from 480 to 660 seconds, and update the pinned Codex ACP adapter from
  `1.1.2` to `1.1.4`.
- Recalibrate review output defaults to a non-blocking 512 KiB warning and a
  1 MiB hard breaker, make the ten-finding limit a soft target, and continue
  optional phases when token usage is unknown by default.
- Preserve strictly parseable paid results after output-limit cancellation,
  enforce one absolute review deadline across phases, and align the dogfooding
  MCP client timeout with its 35-minute review preset.
- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.6.0` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions to `@kyo-so/cli@0.12.0`, delivering typed review contracts,
  deterministic finding admission, and explicit coverage through the Plugin runtime.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Typed review contracts with caller-owned focus, non-goals, accepted-risk
  fingerprints, a non-removable safety floor, conditional lenses, and explicit
  review coverage across required perspectives.
- Deterministic finding admission metadata for disposition, change relation,
  evidence quality/references, policy reasons, stable fingerprints, and open
  questions.

### Changed

- Base decisions on admitted `gate` and `actionable` findings. Material
  disagreement is now `disputed` and makes review completion incomplete;
  advisory and pre-existing findings no longer become automatic change work.
- Derive CISA gate dimensions from admitted findings while retaining agent
  CISA notes as advisory evidence, and enforce the configured enabled, gate, and
  dimension switches.
- Move `tools.*` and `reviewPolicy.*` to user-global policy, enforce disabled
  entrypoints/tools before agent startup, and report fixed/reserved config
  values explicitly.
- Limit formal regression recommendations to three concrete, deduplicated
  tests and update the bundled Skill to stop on missing coverage or disputed
  findings without auto-fixing advisory output.
- Keep agent-supplied policy labels out of deterministic admission. Non-goals
  bound optional scope only, while accepted Medium risks require an exact
  validated finding fingerprint.
- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.5.0` and pin its Codex and Claude Code
  MCP definitions to `@kyo-so/cli@0.11.0`, delivering the review execution
  budget and two-pass stop contract through the Plugin runtime.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- User-global review execution budgets with lower-only request overrides,
  absolute deadlines, streamed ACP text-output caps (including thought chunks), token-usage accounting,
  request fingerprints, and structured incomplete-review results.
- Audit events and JSON/Markdown budget reporting for planned, consumed, and
  skipped model calls, wall time, output bytes, token-usage state, and review
  completion reasons.
- A two-pass stop contract for the bundled Kyoso review Skill: one initial
  review plus one confirmation after material fixes, with fingerprint-based
  duplicate prevention and explicit approval required for a third pass.

### Changed

- Promote the Marketplace Plugin to `0.4.0`, pin its Codex and Claude Code MCP
  definitions to `@kyo-so/cli@0.10.0`, and allow clients to forward
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` by name for the existing OpenRouter project opt-in.
- Default the Judge to deterministic-only mode. An LLM Judge now requires an
  explicit `deterministic_plus_llm` opt-in and shares the review call budget.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- User-authorized project-scoped `agents.codex.provider = "openrouter"` and
  inherited OpenRouter model overrides, with a required non-empty Codex model
  for provider selection and a user-global exact absolute-directory
  `allowProjectProvider` allowlist,
  a `provider = "default"` project opt-out that clears an inherited OpenRouter
  model unless the reset layer supplies one, and a fixed OpenRouter Responses
  API preset.
- OpenRouter readiness in `kyoso doctor`, including detected/missing key
  guidance without exposing credential values.
- `kyoso setup --with-openrouter` for explicit `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` forwarding
  in newly generated manual Codex and Claude Code MCP registrations. New Codex
  registrations also include `CODEX_HOME` and `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` alongside
  the existing credential allowlist.
- A release-gated pinned Codex ACP/OpenRouter smoke command that requires an
  explicit environment opt-in and never accepts credentials through argv.

### Changed

- Forward `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to the Codex child only for the OpenRouter
  provider; omit the provider to retain existing Codex login, OpenAI/Codex key,
  and `CODEX_CONFIG` behavior.
- Preserve existing MCP registrations during setup, including disabled entries;
  existing users update their environment allowlist manually.
- Omit `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from new manual MCP registrations unless
  `--with-openrouter` is explicitly requested.
- Keep the released Marketplace Plugin environment contract unchanged: it does
  not forward `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` until a later coordinated Plugin
  promotion.

### Fixed

- Require the explicit `--set` provider and model pair when direct CLI input
  selects OpenRouter, preventing a project-supplied model from completing that
  external-routing selection.
- Resolve existing project allowlist directories by real path and document
  intentional preflight-only audit completion events.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Claude Code Marketplace Plugin distribution with a shared Kyoso Skill and
  version-pinned local stdio MCP server.
- Best-effort post-publish reminders when either Plugin CLI pin lags the
  released CLI version.

### Changed

- Move the Codex Plugin MCP definition to
  `plugins/kyoso/.codex-plugin/mcp.json` so it cannot be auto-discovered by
  Claude Code as a Plugin-root `.mcp.json`.
- Document opt-in per-tool approval settings for avoiding Kyoso rejections in
  Codex Auto mode, including the risk of sending selected code and review
  context to configured external model providers. The Plugin keeps approvals
  disabled by default.
- Update the default `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` adapter from
  `0.57.0` to `0.58.1` for resumed-session model preservation, cancelled-turn
  usage reporting, and streamed-thinking robustness.
- Update `@modelcontextprotocol/server` from `2.0.0-beta.2` to
  `2.0.0-beta.3`, restoring legacy `CallToolResult` parsing tolerance and
  incorporating transport and authentication validation fixes.

### Fixed

- Updated the pinned Codex ACP adapter to `1.1.2`, whose bundled Codex model
  catalog advertises reasoning-effort options for `gpt-5.6` family models.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Codex Marketplace fixture with a version-pinned local stdio MCP, bundled
  `kyoso-review` Skill, isolated runtime probe, and compatibility records for
  Codex CLI 0.144.0-alpha.4 and 0.144.1.
- `kyoso setup codex|claude-code --skill-only` for installing the canonical
  Skill without reading or writing MCP configuration. The setup surface also
  supports `--force` for Skill-only replacement and rejects MCP-only option
  combinations.
- Managed Skill updates with deterministic directory digests,
  `.kyoso-install.json`, published 0.8.0 legacy adoption, user-change conflict
  detection, symlink rejection, and staged backup/rename replacement.

### Changed

- Recover interrupted managed-Skill replacements from a fixed backup, fail
  closed on ambiguous recovery state, and guard rename operations against
  parent-directory replacement.
- Audit traces now use a verified POSIX user state root (`$XDG_STATE_HOME` or
  `$HOME/.local/state`) instead of a workspace-controlled `.kyoso/traces`
  path. The new layout hashes the workspace realpath; existing workspace
  traces are not migrated or deleted automatically.
- The canonical bundled Skill continues to try Kyoso MCP tools, an installed
  `kyoso` on `PATH`, `npx`, then `bunx`, without declaring MCP as a required
  dependency. The generated Marketplace Plugin copy declares its bundled
  `kyoso` MCP server as a dependency; a disabled Plugin MCP must be re-enabled
  or migrated to CLI plus Skill-only rather than falling back to the CLI.
- Codex MCP configuration resolves from `CODEX_HOME`, while global Codex Skill
  installation continues to resolve from `HOME`.

### Fixed

- Harden Audit trace creation against workspace-controlled symlinks and races
  with verified handles, exclusive creation, and fail-closed state-root
  containment. Windows and runtimes without proven safe filesystem
  capabilities disable Audit writing rather than using an insecure fallback;
  Windows support will be re-enabled only after equivalent ownership, symlink,
  and file-identity guarantees are implemented and verified.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Repeatable `--set <config-key>=<value>` option on the `plan`, `security`,
  and `diff` commands for overriding config values such as
  `agents.<agent>.model`, `agents.<agent>.effort`, and `timeoutMs` from the
  command line. Overrides are restricted to the shared project-scope
  allowlist, applied after config files (including with `--ignore-config`),
  and schema-validated.
- CLI fallback in the bundled `kyoso-review` skill: when the Kyoso MCP
  server is not registered, the skill falls back to
  `npx`/`bunx @kyo-so/cli plan|security|diff --json`. The fallback runs
  without config trust flags first and requires user confirmation before
  `--trust-config` or `--ignore-config`. Documented in all README languages.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Update `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0: ACP schema 1.19.0,
  linear-time `ndJsonStream` receive path, and unified JSON-RPC message
  validation across transports.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `agents.<name>.effort` config field for Codex and Claude, mirroring
  `agents.<name>.model`. Kyoso sends it once per session as an ACP
  `session/set_config_option` request (`effort` for Claude,
  `reasoning_effort` for Codex). The request is fail-soft: a rejection is
  logged to stderr as a sanitized warning and surfaced to MCP/JSON callers
  via `result.audit.warnings`, and the review continues at the backend's
  own default effort. Settable from both user-global and project TOML
  (same risk profile as `model`: no command execution or env forwarding).

### Fixed

- Documentation still described the default Claude agent timeout as 240
  seconds; README (all languages), the design document, and the example
  config now reflect the 300-second default introduced in 0.6.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- TOML config loading with XDG user-global layering:
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kyoso/config.toml` or `~/.config/kyoso/config.toml`, then
  project `kyoso.toml`.
- Unknown-key detection for user-global `config.toml`; security-sensitive
  unknown settings fail closed by default, with `--allow-unknown-config` as an
  explicit opt-out.
- Project TOML scope validation for repository-owned settings, including
  additive `workspace.deny` and tightening-only security/network keys.
- `kyoso doctor` now reports global, project TOML, and legacy TypeScript config
  layers.

### Changed

- `kyoso init` now writes `kyoso.toml`.
- `--config` now fails when the specified file does not exist.
- Default Claude agent timeout raised from 240s to 300s; dogfooding traces
  showed frequent reviews truncated at the previous limit.
- Repository dogfooding config and examples now use TOML.

### Deprecated

- `kyoso.config.ts` remains supported through the existing trust flow, but emits
  a deprecation warning. When both `kyoso.toml` and `kyoso.config.ts` exist,
  TOML takes precedence.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Cross-validation classification on aggregated findings: findings backed by
  both agents are marked `corroborated`, single-agent findings `single_source`.
- Fusion-style cross-model analysis from the advisory judge: blind spots,
  semantic contradictions, and partial coverage are reported as advisory
  metadata (`crossModelAnalysis`); the deterministic decision is unchanged.
- Optional adversarial verification round (`verification.enabled`, default
  off): single-source high/critical findings are sent to the other agent with
  a skeptical refute-first prompt. Annotate-only: verdicts adjust confidence
  and notes, never severity or the decision.
- CI-ready MCP stdio and ACP subprocess integration tests now cover the real
  protocol boundaries without live LLM credentials. `pack:verify` also starts
  the packed CLI bin as an MCP server and checks its version and tool list.
- Nix development shell pinning Node.js and Bun for reproducible local setups.

### Changed

- Reviewer prompts now require concise English finding titles (evidence,
  recommendations, and summaries may stay in the user's language) and clarify
  that selected files show the pre-change base state during diff reviews.
- Same-category findings that reference overlapping line ranges in the same
  file now merge regardless of title wording, so cross-model corroboration no
  longer depends on title phrasing.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/server` to 2.0.0-beta.2 and
  `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` to 1.1.0. Before release, the MCP stdio server
  handshake was smoke-tested against beta.2 and a full multi-agent review run
  was verified with real Codex and Claude agents on the updated ACP stack.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Pinned default ACP adapter versions (`@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.0`,
  `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.57.0`) so adapter updates ship
  through deliberate Kyoso releases instead of being fetched as `latest` at
  runtime. Overrides via `kyoso.config.ts` still work.
- Version consistency enforcement: `bun test` and `pack:verify` fail when the
  MCP server version constant drifts from `package.json`, and release builds
  fail when the git tag does not match the package version.
- CI and release workflows install dependencies through Aikido safe-chain,
  blocking known-malicious package versions before they execute.
- `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` metadata in `package.json` (required
  for provenance validation).

### Changed

- Releases are now published via npm trusted publishing (OIDC) from GitHub
  Actions with provenance attestation. Verify with `npm audit signatures`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Single-agent mode: Kyoso now works when only Claude or only Codex is
  available. The remaining backend runs once as `combined_reviewer`, covering
  both implementation and architecture/security focus areas.
- `reviewMode` (`multi_agent` / `single_agent`) and `agentsUsed` in JSON
  output; Markdown output states when cross-model verification was not
  performed and marks Disagreements as N/A.
- `kyoso doctor` and `kyoso setup` suggest a single-agent config when only
  one backend command is found on PATH.
- `examples/claude-only.config.ts` and `examples/codex-only.config.ts`.

### Changed

- Agent role prompts are driven by `agents.<name>.role` in `kyoso.config.ts`
  instead of being hardcoded per agent name. Default configs behave the same;
  customized `role` values now take effect.

### Fixed

- The MCP server reports the correct package version (previously stuck at
  0.1.0).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- `kyoso setup codex` / `kyoso setup claude-code` for one-command MCP
  registration and review-skill installation.
- Quick Start documentation and expanded `kyoso doctor` diagnostics.
- Japanese and Simplified Chinese READMEs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Initial public release: MCP-native, ACP-powered multi-agent review gate
  coordinating Codex and Claude reviewers for plan review, CISA Secure by
  Design security review, and diff review.
- Deterministic decision gates, secret scanning with redaction, read-only
  temp-snapshot workspaces, and JSONL audit traces.
